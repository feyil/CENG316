# CENG316 Software Engineering Project

This is a course given 6th semester of the undergraduate program of computer engineering at Izmir Institute of Technology.

In the scope of the course, all students tried to complete the  **Computer Engineering Website Management Desktop App Project**. The five-member group with a given research assistant in the role of the product owner.

We arranged meetings with our research assistant to analyze the exact requirement of the given project. After then we wrote SRS and SDD then we made implementation partially.

We followed **Waterfall Software Development Methodology** to complete the project with a **Software Requirement Document** and 
a **Software Design Document**.

Project Implementation Planned with
* Java 8 as a development platform
* JavaFX Library for GUI
* ControlFX Library for GUI
* MySQL as a database

**Note**: We chose Java because of the existing skill set. However, my observation of other groups shows me that it is not a good idea to use such a stack. Nevertheless, we were able to prove that we can do what we claim to do.
